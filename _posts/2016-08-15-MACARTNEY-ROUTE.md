## MACARTNEY'S ROUTE 1793
中华帝国是一艘陈旧而又古怪的一流战舰,在过去的一百五十年中,代代相继的能干而 警觉的官员设法使它飘浮着,并凭借其庞大与外观而使四邻畏惧。但当一位才不敷用的人掌舵领航时,它便失去了纪律与安全。 它可能不会立即沉没,它可能会像残舸一样飘流旬日,然后在海岸上粉身碎骨,但却无法在其破旧的基础上重建起来。

The empire of China is an old, crazy, first-rate Man of War, which a succession of able and vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat for these hundred and fifty years past, and to overawe(吓到) their neighbors merely by her bulk and appearance. But whenever an insufficient man happens to have the command on deck, adieu to the, discipline and safety of the ship. She may, perhaps, not sink outright; she may drift some time as a wreck, and will then be dashed to pieces on the shores; but she can never be rebuilt on the bottom.

"No one understands China until this document has ceased to seem absurd," remarked Bertrand Russel1
